A Streamlined Pipeline based on HmmUFOtu for Microbial Community Profiling Using 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing

Microbial community profiling using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing allows for taxonomic characterization of diverse microorganisms. We present a streamlined pipeline that integrates FastP for read trimming, HmmUFOtu for OTU clustering, Vsearch for chimera checking, and Kraken2 for taxonomic assignment.
